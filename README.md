## Quarto Quickstart

Besides cloning this respository, you need to install [quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

[Here](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) you find the documentation on building websites.

To see changes locally, run the preview command (in the terminal):

```bash
$ quarto preview
```

Before committing, render once more so that redundant files are not pushed to the repository.

```bash
$ quarto render
```

Stage and commit your changes, then push to this repository.
The repo is automatically pushed to github and the website is refreshed by github actions.

To learn more about markdown (the language that Quarto is based on) you can check out one of the following cheatsheets: [basics on a single page](https://www.markdown-cheatsheet.com/), [gitrepo with examples](https://github.com/im-luka/markdown-cheatsheet).
