Hey, it's great that you want to contribute to the project!

Landelijke Docs is open-source, and as such, anyone can contribute! For those used to using git repositories the process will be familiar.

You are welcome to contribute to our platform in two ways.

- Create a new Codeberg Issue

|       Head over to our issue page on Codeberg to let us know about bugs, feature requests for the website, or anything that you would love to see developed for your 
|       research project (e.g., a code snippet). You can also attach files.

- Contribute directly via Pull Requests

Already familiar with Codeberg and Pull Requests? Than fork our repository, work on your changes in a fresh branch, and submit a pull request.

Need a step-by-step tutorial on how to do that? [Read more about pull requests here](https://docs.codeberg.org/collaborating/pull-requests-and-git-flow/).

# What is a contribution?

Anything from simple changes, grammar checks and reporting a bug to more elaborate changes and writing entirely new content!

We basically welcome any kind of feedback and contribution, including but not limited to:

-   general fixes (typos, small sentences)
-   elaborate changes (modifying, adding or removing an entire paragraph or chapter)
-   asking for new content to be added
-   submitting an article without worrying about formatting (even a Word file!)
-   reporting a bug
-   requesting a new feature on the website
-   general tips or questions on the project
-   beautification work
-   graphics to use in or out of articles

# How is the content organized?

We provide content in five categories:

*   Articles are concepts in small doses, the DNA of our platform. They are short guides on a subtopic teaching fundamental concepts in software development. Information is explained in a way that it is easy to clone or implement in an existing project. While everybody can follow our articles, they are generally more appealing to advanced users – or those who already know what to look for.

*   Paths are collections of articles relevant to a role or type of project that will be interspersed with examples for learners to follow. 

*   Programmes are institution crafted paths. Some institutions might prefer their own materials or think that more or fewer article should be in a path.

*   The Learning Bank contains all learning resources created by our partners and contributors.

*   Outside resources, a list of organised links for 3rd party resources that contributors have found to be useful and well written/spoken/filmed.
