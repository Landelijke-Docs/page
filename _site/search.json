This could be anything, from a task like setting up the folder for a new project, to filling out forms, to creating graphs from your data, to converting folders of audio files to text.\nIf you can break something down in to small concrete tasks you can get a computer to do it for you, whether this is building a model for your data, simulating your lab environment, or repeating the 101 plots from your different filters on your dataset.\nTo get started check out the good practice page or choose the path that works for you!"

The process is really simple.\nYou are welcome to contribute to our platform in two ways. Create a new Codeberg Issue\nHead over to our issue page on Codeberg to let us know about bugs, feature requests for the website, or anything that you would love to see developed for your research project (e.g., a code snippet). You can also attach files. Contribute directly via Pull Requests\nAlready familiar with Codeberg and Pull Requests? Than fork our repository, work on your changes in a fresh branch, and submit a pull request.\nNeed a step-by-step tutorial on how to do that? Read more about pull requests here.\n\n\nWhat is a contribution?\nAnything from simple changes, grammar checks and reporting a bug to more elaborate changes and writing entirely new content!\nWe basically welcome any kind of feedback and contribution, including but not limited to:\n- general fixes (typos, small sentences)\n- elaborate changes (modifying, adding or removing an entire paragraph or chapter)\n- asking for new content to be added\n- submitting an article without worrying about formatting (even a Word file!)\n- reporting a bug\n- requesting a new feature on the website\n- general tips or questions on the project\n\n\nHow is the content organized?\nWe provide content in three forms:\nBuilding Blocks are concepts in small doses, the DNA of our platform. They are small code snippets that users can independently \"mix\" to create something unique, like LEGO bricks. These allow us to explain the theory while also providing some practical examples and code snippets for a variety of programming languages or operating systems. Information is explained in a way that it is easy to clone or implement in an existing project. While everybody can follow our Building Blocks, they are generally more appealing to advanced users – or those who already know what to look for.\n\nTutorials explain a broader argument compared to Building Blocks, and follow a sequential order. They teach our users how to combine individual building blocks into a \"final product\". These are particularly useful for novices or anyone new to a certain topic because of their comprehensive nature and step-by-step guidance. We support and encourage the use of videos, exercises, and quizzes in a tutorial.\n\nExamples are real-life cases, publications, templates, or research projects that put into practice the concepts explained on this website.\nKindly stolen form Tilburg Uni"

    "title": "Accessibility Policy of Landelijke Docs Community",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Within the Landelijke Docs community, we define accessibility practices as a set of community-wide, behavioural, social, and technical decisions that can be taken to ensure that all are welcome and are able to enter and participate in research, data-driven processes, communities and events despite any barriers for access.\nWhile accessibility is commonly understood with respect to disability, we – meaning the Landelijke Docs community – define accessibility as giving access to everyone, with specific attention given to ensuring proper access for groups of people that encounter different barriers for participation. Barriers may be anything related to, including, and extending beyond the following: - Age - Disability - Ethnicity and race - Family - Language (written and/or spoken) - Geography - Nationality - Religion, faith and belief - Sex and gender - Sexual orientation - Socioeconomic status - Technical or disciplinary background - Mental health - Digital barriers (such as connectivity, computational capacity, and design)\nWe recognise the complex and interlinking ways in which intersectionality affects identity, and thereby, access or inclusion within any community project like Landelijke Docs. So in this sense, our accessibility practices may overlap with practices that enable inclusion more broadly within any community.\nIn developing this policy, we aim to draw from the access-centered framework in describing access as a constant process that changes in each space with each individual. This document is a part of a broader collection of documentation across accessibility, listed below: - Accessibility policy: Our vision and guiding principles for how we practice accessibility. - Community Handbook Accessibility Guidelines: Practical advice to build accessibility into your contributions and activity within the community. - Accessibility Guide: A broader discussion of accessibility and access-related practices that extend beyond Landelijke Docs.\nEach resource (this Accessibility Policy, Community Handbook Accessibility Guidelines, and our Accessibility Guide) plays a different yet overlapping role in enabling, documenting, and sharing our evolving language around accessible and inclusive collaboration.\nThis policy is a work in progress, as are the practices that we employ as a community. Much like how Landelijke Docs is always being written and rewritten, our accessibility policies and practices are constantly being updated as broader awareness grows and changes in technology are made.\n\n\nThese core principles are at the heart of our accessibility policy, and they extend beyond the web accessibility of our open access guides to our broader practices as a community, expanded upon in Section 2.0.\nThis means that questions of access are tied to how people read the guides as well as their ability to participate in the project and the community. Participation in Landelijke Docs itself can be defined broadly, but doing so often requires navigating a number of different platforms. In all contexts, we aim to facilitate access in a broad sense through:\n\nRemoving barriers: We actively advocate for and employ tactics that seek to remove barriers for any current or future participants in our community. This may include people who have historically been limited or structurally excluded from participating due to any of the barriers listed above.\nSharing openly: We aim to draft, write, review, and edit our open access guides using open practices documented in our guides. We do this in order to enable people from a broad range of backgrounds to get involved in the project.\nSupporting inclusive participation: We acknowledge that openness alone does not make a project accessible in a broad sense, and we are committed to maintaining a socio-technical infrastructure that enables inclusive participation more broadly. This includes hosting spaces for contribution, documenting our practices, and actively gathering feedback.\n\nThe practices and policies listed here relate to these three operating principles, which shape how we work within the community to enable access on the web, on our community platforms, and while planning events.\n\n\nAs an open source community that relies on projects and platforms for our underlying infrastructure, we acknowledge that Landelijke Docs is limited in what standalone access-centred support we can offer.\nWith this being said, we are committed to ensuring greater access to our guides, events, and community platforms through a variety of ways.\n\nEnsuring web accessibility for our open access resources: Our project is built with JupyterBook on the Github platform, which have initiatives that address their compliance with W3C WAI’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0. As a community documentation project, we aim to use and employ appropriate and relevant alt text (also known as ‘alternative text’ for all of our images, charts, and data visualisations.\nEnabling accessibility of our shared community platforms: Our community is dedicated to enabling access across the various platforms we communicate on, which extends not only to the accessibility practices mentioned above, but also to the language we employ to ensure a broad audience. Our slack welcome guide delineates best practices we use on the platform.\nImplementing accessible practices for community events: As a community, we frequently organise events for a variety of purposes: for coworking, training, workshops, panels, conference talks, and more. We are committed to supplying and recording audio transcripts and closed captioning, uploading slides and/or presentation materials, and enabling broad access to our program content as described in our community handbook.\n\n\n\n\nGathering access-related feedback is integral for ensuring that we can remain accessible as a community. We would like to offer a a few ways of sharing feedback with us, and are currently working to develop the following initiatives:\n\nFeedback form: Please submit access related comments to our accessibility feedback form. All of the information in this form is processed anonymously, with the option of submitting contact information by choice.\nDrop-in sessions: Throughout the calendar year, we would like to facilitate drop-in session to receive feedback about access related different parts of project. These may take place at our Collaboration Cafe or may be hosted separately.\nEmail us: You can reach out to the Project Delivery Team by emailing turingway@turing.ac.uk. You can also reach out to specific members of the team.\nAttend the Accessibility Working Group meeting: The Accessibility Working Group meetings may be a place where you can deliver feedback in a small group environment. As of December 2024, these meetings are held on Zoom on the second Monday of each month at 17:00 UK time. Please subscribe to the community calendar or download the calendar to stay up to date with meeting times. Please join the #Accessibility channel on slack for more information.\n\nWe recognise that oftentimes feedback and evaluation forms operate as ‘blackboxes’ that receive information without taking actionable steps to address them. Knowing this, we are actively working to develop processes that enable us to implement feedback and to report transparently. These may include:\n\nReporting within the Accessibility Working Group in order to discuss possible actions that can be taken to address feedback. Currently, this process is under development.\nLiaising with appropriate groups within the Landelijke Docs project (for example, the Infrastructure Working Group) in order to create or resource technical changes that may be needed. Information about these working groups can be found in {ref}subprojects.\nEscalating feedback to the project co-leads, funders, and others at the constitutional level of the project as needed.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, all reports will be kept confidential. If submitted through a non-anonymised option, when the team discusses incidents and feedback, we will anonymise details as much as we can to protect reporter privacy. In some cases we may determine that a public statement will need to be made. If that’s the case, the identities of all victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.\n\n\n\nWe recognise that our project relies on a number of third party platforms, and that all of these platforms may not be accessible by default. In future iterations of this policy and guidelines, we aim to employ community audits to understand and review the use of these platforms and their commitment and process for accessibility.\n\n\n\nThis Accessibility Policy was created by The Turing Way.\nIn developing this policy, we have referred to numerous people who and resources that have developed similar materials.\nContributors to the initial document are Alexandra Araujo Alvarez, Andrea Sanchez-Tapia, Anne Lee Steele, Arielle Bennett, Chi Zhang, Esther Plomp, Laurel Ascenzi, Harriet Sands, Jesica Formoso, Jim Madge, Léllé Demertzi, Liz Hare, Malvika Sharan, Patricia Loto, Precious Onyewuchi, Richard Acton, Sara Villa, Saranjeet Kaur, Sophia Batchelor, and Tania Allard. Initial drafts of this policy have been made and were documented from 2022 to 2024.\nWe also refer to the resources and process of Silvia Canelon’s “Accessibility Commitment”, and have reviewed a number of Accessibility and Access-related policies in the drafting of this document. This includes the Open Accessibility Policy project, the Wigan Accessibility Statement, gov.uk guidance, and Metadocencia’s Accessibility Policy, a resource for accessibility in open science communities."

There are contributors from all sorts of research institutions and roles as well as those outside academia. The aim is to gather all the software related resources that are being produced both inside and outside of academia and, like the coding DJs we are, cut and chop them up into a best of while providing links to the originals.

    "text": "2.1 Expected Behaviour\nWe are confident that our community members will together build a supportive and collaborative atmosphere at our events and during online communications. The following bullet points set out explicitly what we hope you will consider to be appropriate community guidelines:\n\nBe respectful of different viewpoints and experiences. Do not engage in homophobic, racist, transphobic, ageist, ableist, sexist, or otherwise exclusionary behaviour.\nUse welcoming and inclusive language. Exclusionary comments or jokes, threats or violent language are not acceptable. Do not address others in an angry, intimidating, or demeaning manner. Be considerate of the ways the words you choose may impact others. Be patient and respectful of the fact that English is a second (or third or fourth!) language for some participants.\nDo not harass people. Harassment includes unwanted physical contact, sexual attention, or repeated social contact. Know that consent is explicit, conscious and continuous—not implied. If you are unsure whether your behaviour towards another person is welcome, ask them. If someone tells you to stop, do so.\nRespect the privacy and safety of others. Do not take photographs of others without their permission. Do not share other participants’ personal experiences without their express permission. Note that posting (or threatening to post) personally identifying information of others without their consent (“doxing”) is a form of harassment.\nBe considerate of others’ participation. Everyone should have an opportunity to be heard. In update sessions, please keep comments succinct so as to allow maximum engagement by all participants. Do not interrupt others on the basis of disagreement; hold such comments until they have finished speaking.\nDon’t be a bystander. If you see something inappropriate happening, speak up. If you don’t feel comfortable intervening but feel someone should, please feel free to ask a member of the Code of Conduct response team for support.\nAs an overriding general rule, please be intentional in your actions and humble in your mistakes.\n\nAll interactions should be professional regardless of platform: either online or in-person. See this explanation of the four social rules - no feigning surprise, no well-actually’s, no back-seat driving, no subtle -isms - for further recommendations for inclusive behaviours."

In ongoing situations, any member may at their discretion employ any of the tools available in this enforcement manual, including bans and blocks online, or removal from a physical space.\nIn situations where an individual community member acts unilaterally, they must inform the committee as soon as possible, and report their actions for review within 24 hours."

The CoC committee will provide a written summary of the information surrounding the incident. All participants will be anonymised in the summary report, referred to as “Community Member 1”, “Community Member 2”, or “Research Team Member 1”. The “de-anonymising key” will be kept in a separate file and only accessed to link repeated reports against the same person over time.\nThe CoC committee will aim to have a resolution agreed upon within one week. In the event that a resolution can’t be determined in that time, a member of the CoC committee will respond to the reporter(s) with an update and projected timeline for resolution."

In this case, the person who has the conversation will provide a written summary for record keeping.\nA private written reprimand from a member of the committee to the individual(s) involved. In this case, the committee member will deliver that reprimand to the individual(s) over email for record keeping.\nA public announcement of an incident, ideally in the same venue that the violation occurred (such as on the listserv for a listserv violation; and Codeberg for a Codeberg violation). The committee may choose to publish this message elsewhere for posterity.\nAn imposed “time out” from online spaces. Committee members will communicate this “time out” to the individual(s) involved.\nA permanent or temporary ban from some or all Landelijke Docs project spaces (like on Codeberg, online calls or in-person events). The committee will maintain records of all such bans so that they may be reviewed in the future, extended to a Code of Conduct safety team as it is built, or otherwise maintained. If a member of the community is removed from an event they will not be reimbursed for any part of the event that they miss.\n\nOnce a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, a member of the CoC committee will contact the original reporter and any other affected parties and explain the proposed resolution. The CoC committee member will ask if this resolution is acceptable, and must note feedback for the record. However, the CoC committee is not required to act on this feedback."

For those used to using git repositories the process will be familiar.\nYou are welcome to contribute to our platform in two ways.\n\nCreate a new Codeberg Issue\n\n      Head over to our issue page on Codeberg to let us know about bugs, feature requests for the website, or anything that you would love to see developed for your\n      research project (e.g., a code snippet). You can also attach files.\n\nContribute directly via Pull Requests\n\nAlready familiar with Codeberg and Pull Requests? Than fork our repository, work on your changes in a fresh branch, and submit a pull request.\nNeed a step-by-step tutorial on how to do that? Read more about pull requests here.\n\nWhat is a contribution?\nAnything from simple changes, grammar checks and reporting a bug to more elaborate changes and writing entirely new content!\nWe basically welcome any kind of feedback and contribution, including but not limited to:\n\ngeneral fixes (typos, small sentences)\nelaborate changes (modifying, adding or removing an entire paragraph or chapter)\nasking for new content to be added\nsubmitting an article without worrying about formatting (even a Word file!)\nreporting a bug\nrequesting a new feature on the website\ngeneral tips or questions on the project\nbeautification work\ngraphics to use in or out of articles\n\n\n\nHow is the content organized?\nWe provide content in three forms:\n\nBuilding Blocks are concepts in small doses, the DNA of our platform. They are small code snippets that users can independently “mix” to create something unique, like LEGO bricks. These allow us to explain the theory while also providing some practical examples and code snippets for a variety of programming languages or operating systems. Information is explained in a way that it is easy to clone or implement in an existing project. While everybody can follow our Building Blocks, they are generally more appealing to advanced users – or those who already know what to look for.\nTutorials explain a broader argument compared to Building Blocks, and follow a sequential order. They teach our users how to combine individual building blocks into a “final product”. These are particularly useful for novices or anyone new to a certain topic because of their comprehensive nature and step-by-step guidance. We support and encourage the use of videos, exercises, and quizzes in a tutorial.\nExamples are real-life cases, publications, templates, or research projects that put into practice the concepts explained on this website.\n\n\n\nTODO list"

Welcome to Landelijke Docs, a national effort to collectively produce the clearest and most comprehensive documentation and guides on research software.\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to Landelijke Docs, this is an informal community effort to collect and collate software good practice, guides, and guidelines. The initiative is born out of requests of the support staff to provide guides and instead of every institute having its own version covering every topic in a few years we work together to have one version now.\nThis is a living project that is developing and growing all the time. We are starting with a learning bank with courses, presentations, guides, and documentation created by our partners and curated lists of 3rd party resources. The next step is creating clear and readable articles about the core aspects of reseach software and the good practices to follow. Once the basics are covered we will be working with researchers to write guides and articles on the best practice for all topics and fields.\nWe are always looking for contributors, if you want to know more check out the contributing page!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartners\nA list of the current project partners.
